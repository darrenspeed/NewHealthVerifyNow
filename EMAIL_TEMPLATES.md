## ðŸ“§ **COLD OUTREACH EMAIL #1: PAIN POINT FOCUS**

**Subject**: Are you still manually checking OIG exclusions? [First Name]

Hi [First Name],

I noticed that [Company Name] has been growing significantly in the [specific area, e.g., "Dallas healthcare market"]. With expansion often comes increased compliance requirements - particularly around employee verification.

Most healthcare organizations I speak with are still manually checking OIG and SAM exclusions, which typically takes:
â€¢ 30+ minutes per employee verification
â€¢ Hours of staff time for audit preparation  
â€¢ Risk of human error in the process

**Quick question**: How much time does your team currently spend on compliance verification each month?

I've helped organizations like [similar company] reduce their verification time by 95% while improving audit readiness. Would you be interested in a 10-minute conversation about how this might apply to [Company Name]?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. I can show you exactly how this works with a quick 5-minute demo - no commitment required.

## ðŸ“§ **COLD OUTREACH EMAIL #2: ROI FOCUS**

**Subject**: Save $2,400/month on compliance verification - [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

If your team is manually verifying employee compliance (OIG/SAM exclusions), you're likely spending $2,000-4,000 monthly in staff time alone.

**Here's a quick calculation**:
â€¢ 100 employees Ã— 30 minutes verification = 50 staff hours
â€¢ 50 hours Ã— $25/hour = $1,250 in direct labor costs
â€¢ Add audit preparation and the real cost is $2,000-4,000/month

**What if you could reduce this to under $400/month** while improving accuracy and audit readiness?

That's exactly what Health Verify Now delivers for healthcare organizations like [Company Name]. We've automated the entire verification process:

âœ“ 30-second verification (vs 30 minutes manual)
âœ“ Real-time OIG database (81,976+ records)  
âœ“ Audit-ready documentation
âœ“ $3.95/employee/month (Professional tier)

Would you be interested in seeing a 5-minute demo of how this works?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
