**Quantify the Benefits:**
- **Time Savings**: *"Instead of 30 minutes per verification, this takes 30 seconds - that's a 60x improvement"*

---

### **OBJECTION HANDLING**

#### **"We do this manually and it works fine"**
*"I understand that. Many of our customers said the same thing. The question is: what happens when you have an audit? Can you quickly produce documentation for every verification? And what if you scale up hiring? Manual processes that work for 10 employees become overwhelming for 100."*

#### **"This seems expensive"**
*"Let me put this in perspective. If one employee takes 30 minutes to verify manually, and you pay that person $20/hour, that's $10 per verification. Our service costs $3.95 per month per employee, which typically covers multiple verifications. You're actually saving money from day one."*

#### **"We need to check with IT/Security"**
*"Absolutely, and I'd be happy to connect with your IT team. We use enterprise-grade security with PayPal for payments and bank-level encryption for data. I can provide a security assessment document for their review."*

#### **"We need to think about it"**
*"Of course, this is an important decision. What specific concerns do you have that I can address? Also, would it be helpful if I could arrange a 30-day pilot with 5 free verifications so you can see the value firsthand?"*
